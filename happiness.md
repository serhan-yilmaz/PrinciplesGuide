## Compendium of Life Principles: How to live a satisfying life and form meaningful relationships?

### 2. Happiness

##### Principle of Effort

- Take responsibility for your happiness and well-being. 
  - As an adult, it is your responsibility. Take reins, don't take the role of a victim.  
- Focus on what you can control. 
  - Focus on what's ahead and what you can change. Don't get stuck living in the past. Leave out what you cannot control. Make peace with them. No one is omnipotent. 
  - Don't take responsibility for events out of your control. Take responsibility for what you can influence. This is the essence of stoic philosophy. 
- Take action. Do what you need to do. 
  - Fulfill your needs first. Ensure your safety. 
  - Take care of your health and physical well-being. Also, mental health. 
  - Build strong interpersonal relationships that feel meaningful. 
  - Ask: What would make you proud of yourself? 
- Check out [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs). 
  - Physiological needs first. Food, sleep, shelter and so on. 
  - Safety needs afterwards. Personal, emotional and financial. Also, health. 
  - Love and social needs comes next. Trust, acceptance, intimacy, sex. Friends, family, community. A sense of belonging. 
  - Esteem needs later. Self-respect, confidence, competence. Being proud of yourself. 
  - What comes afterwards? Living true to yourself. How does it happen? Aligning your beliefs and actions. Doing what you believe is right. Having a sense of purpose and meaning. 

##### Principle of Serenity

- Learn to be content with what you have. 
  - Limit wants. Wants have no end if left unbounded, since it is human desire to always want more. Aim to understand why do you want what you want. What do you truly desire?
  - This doesn't mean don't be ambitious. Quite the contrary. Exercise actions you deem appropriate, but leave out the rest. Don't mull over what could or should have happened. 
  - Don't compare yourself with others. Comparison is a thief of joy. 
- Be cautiously optimistic. 
  - In essence, hope for the best and prepare for the worst. 
  - Be realistic, don't neglect to take precautions. But, stay optimistic afterwards. Believe that it is going to be okay, one way or another. Don't worry too much, especially for things out of your control. 
  - Appreciate the good in your life. See the glass [half full](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_the_glass_half_empty_or_half_full%3F).  
- Don't take yourself or life so seriously. 
  - A little humor goes a long way. Life is too short to worry too much. 
  - Stop to smell the roses along the way. Appreciate beauty.
  - Don't let work define you. View it as a part, a means for a purpose. 

##### Principle of Purpose
- Focus on the process, not outcome. 
  - Life is not a race, don't rush till the end. Grand finale is already determined from the beginning: Your life will come to an end. 
  - Don't forget the future and the long term. But also, don't forget there is an end. Do the things you want to do while you can.
  - Enjoy the process. Be open to trying new things and explore. 
- Consider right actions, rather than right outcomes. 
  - [Buddhist philosophy:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_philosophy) The source of frustration is not losing. It is the desire to win, the desire to reach a particular outcome. [Related comic](https://existentialcomics.com/comic/102). 
  - Doing and expecting are different. Do, but don't expect. 
  - Engage in actions because they are right, given the available knowledge. Do not regret a contrary or undesirable outcome of an action that seemed right at the time. See it as a learning experience, it is part of the process.  
  - Be content in knowing that you did what you are supposed to do, regardless of outcome.
- Aim for a meaningful life, not for happiness.
  - Aiming for happiness typically leads to comfort and pleasure seeking behavior. Successful in the short run, but detrimental in the long run for happiness. 
  - Paradoxically, aiming for what feels meaningful leads to behaviour that reinforce happiness in the long run. 
    - What feels meaningful is typically productive actions that involve other people, that are beneficial to others and the community. Engaging in such behavior typically results in positive feedback and improve personal satisfaction. 
- Deal with reality, and accept it. Describe and understand how things happen. Do not assert how things are supposed to happen. 
  - Learn to distinguish fantasy from reality, opinion from fact, impressions from knowledge. Acknowledge subjectivity in life.
