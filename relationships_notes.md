## Compendium of Life Principles: How to live a satisfying life and form meaningful relationships?

### 1. Relationships

#### Notes

##### Reciprocal Relations and Goodwill

- Ally yourself with others who will engage in reciprocal behaviour in good will. 
- Prioritize forming mutually beneficial connections. Engage in reciprocal behavior and do favors because you care. 
  - Not because you have something in mind that you would like to receive. 
- Accept favors proportional to what you are willing to give. 
- Exercise caution. If someone haven't earned your trust yet, assess the motivation behind any favors you receive. 
  - Is the intention to connect, or is it to leave you indebted before making a request? If it seems like the latter, disengage. It's not worth it.
  - Is the favor big? Refuse, or proceed with extreme caution. Disengage if there are any strings attached, however small. 
  - Does the person has a habit of gossip? Refuse, unless the favor is minor or truly needed. 
    - Instead, start the reciprocal loop by offering a favor yourself, if you would like to connect.  
    - Disengage, if they don't accept any favors and are only interested in offering on their terms. Their interest may lie in gaining power over you rather than to connect. 
- Acknowledge that you are not obligated to fulfill a request in return for a previous favor, particularly from someone you don't trust yet.  
  - You can always reciprocate later and make up for it in a way of your choosing. Doesn't violate loyalty.
  - A bad actor may not be happy with this. Not a big issue for someone whose aim is to connect. 
  - However, lean towards acceptance if it's going to be a huge help to the requestor while not being a substantial cost to you. Assess risks and potential. See it as an opportunity to connect, if desirable.
- Communicate values clearly. Express appreciation appropriately. 
  - Don't pretend something is a huge help while it is not. Likewise, do not understate if something was truly helpful. 
  - Do not negotiate favors. Only clarify the benefits and costs to you. 
    - Negotiate transactions, not favors. 
  - Never criticize a behavior that you would like to see repeated. Instead, validate and give positive feedback by expressing appreciation.  
- Address the person themself in your communications, particularly in conflicts. 
  - Do not gossip, nor bring other people in the middle of your interactions. 
  - Likewise, do not trust or ally with someone who engage in such behavior, unless necessary.
- Try to leave good impressions, it makes a difference.
  - However, do not aim to impress people deliberately. That can backfire easily.
- Understand that [costly actions are effective signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costly_signaling_theory_in_evolutionary_psychology). 
  - They are effective because: They are difficult to fake. For example, carrying expensive jewelry works as a signal of wealth because not everyone can accept that cost. 
  - This applies to demonstrating goodwill as well. Time, effort and the resulting history can function as big costs for this purpose. Similarly, the ability to handle rejections or losses gracefully can be an effective indicator of goodwill. 

##### Cognitive Distortions

- Understand [black swan counter-example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) and recognize that unpredictable, singular events can occur. Avoid [black and white thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_(psychology)) and do not make generalized statements that are absolute. 
  - "All swans are white" is an absolute and unprovable statement. But, one counter-example is enough to disprove it. 
    - Thus, such statements are unlikely to be correct. Exceptions happen. 
  - *Over-generalization*: Making sweeping conclusions based on a few events. 
    - Example: All woman are liars, and therefore, cannot be trusted. 
  - *All or nothing thinking*: Dealing in extremes, either absolutely good or bad. 
    - Example: I was only able to get third place in the race. I am a failure. 
    - Another example: I was on a diet, but ate chips after dinner. I fucked up. I've ruined my diet now. I am a complete failure. 
    - In reality, magnitudes matter. There is an in-between. 
    - Think probabilistic, not deterministic. There is uncertainty. 
- Do not [jump to conclusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_to_conclusions). Realize that you can't know or predict everything. 
  - Acknowledge that uncertainty is everywhere in life. Avoid absolute judgements. 
  - *Mind reading*: Assuming what someone must be thinking or feeling, beyond reason. Avoid making big conclusions based on minor behaviors. Behaviors only go so far in understanding thoughts and intentions.
    - Example: I know you don’t like me. How so? You didn't invite me to lunch.
  - *Fortune-telling*: Predicting outcomes in absolute terms. 
    - Example: A depressed person believing they will never improve and nothing will ever be resolved for their whole life. 
    - Another example: I'll never find a job. I'll be unemployed forever.
  - *Labeling*: Overly-reductive description of other people's characteristics.
    - Example: He didn't call me. He must be a narcissist! 
- Be mindful of behaviors that turn into [self-fulfilling prophecies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy). 
  - "You create your own reality" phrase has a point. Beliefs heavily influence perception and behaviors. They can decisively affect outcomes, particularly when it comes to relationships. 
    - For example, rejection expectations can lead to [behaviors that elicit rejection from others](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.75.2.545). 
    - They also shape your subjective experiences to a large degree. [Placebo effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo#Effects) comes to mind. 
  - Optimism and having a positive outlook help in human relations. The vibe you give to others is shaped by your perspective and mood. 
    - Note that, faking doesn't necessarily help much. Believing does. 
  - Believe that future is not fixed and can be changed if not desirable. Exert will and take action. Focus on things that can help, one step at a time. 
    - You may be unsure whether you will be able to achieve your goals by trying. But, one thing is near-certain: You won't succeed if you never try. Assess pros and cons, then make your move. 
  - Examples of defeatist attitude that turn into self-fulfilling prophecies:
    - I won't study to the exam. I am going to fail anyway. 
    - I can't make any friends. People don't like me. I better stay away.
    - I'm terrible at math. I'll never understand this lesson. No use listening. 
    - I won’t even try asking out. They’ll definitely reject me. I'll be alone forever. 
    - No one can be trusted. Must be vigilant. Better them than me.  
- [Emotional Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_reasoning): Believing emotions as facts, independent of any empirical evidence. 
  - Example: I feel jealous, which means my partner must be unfaithful. I wouldn't feel jealous if my partner were faithful. 
  - Another example: I feel overwhelmed. It's impossible to even start.
