## Compendium of Life Principles: How to live a satisfying life and form meaningful relationships?

### Preface

The goal of this writing is to summarize a set of rules that I believe to be important and beneficial to follow while making personal decisions. Most are obvious principles, but they are sometimes overlooked. So, I believe it is helpful to remember and repeat what's important. 

To explain my view with an analogy: Principles serve as a compass that, in a dark tunnel where the road ahead is unclear, can help find the right way out, without getting lost. So, I say follow the compass when in doubt. 

Overall, this is meant to be a practical guide, aiming for what is best personally and "what can help" rather than prescribing morals on "what should". Since I believe actions are ultimately what counts, I expressed the principles in the form of actionable terms, with pointers for further concepts to learn. 

With these in mind, the first principle and a warning to follow: 

#### Principle of Advice

- Take all advice with a grain of salt, think critically and assess limitations.
- Realize there is no single answer, multiple paths can reach the same destination.
- But, don't ignore what is obvious. If everywhere smells shit, look under your shoe. 
- Most importantly, live and be true to yourself.
