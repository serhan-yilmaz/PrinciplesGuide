## Compendium of Life Principles: How to live a satisfying life and form meaningful relationships?

### Preface

The goal of this writing is to summarize a set of rules that I believe to be important and beneficial to follow while making personal decisions. Most are obvious principles, but they are sometimes overlooked. So, I believe it is helpful to remember and repeat what's important. 

To explain my view with an analogy: Principles serve as a compass that, in the absence of light and when faced with uncertainty, can help find the right way, without getting lost. So, follow the compass when in doubt. 

Overall, this is meant to be a practical guide, aiming for what is best personally and "what can help", as opposed to prescribing morals on "what should" and what is best for the society. 

With that in mind, the first principle and a disclaimer to follow: 

##### Principle of Advice

- Take all advice with a grain of salt, think critically and assess limitations.
- Realize there is no single answer, multiple paths can reach the same destination.
- But, don't ignore what is obvious. If everywhere smells shit, look under your shoe. 
- Most importantly, live and be true to yourself.

### 1. Relationships

#### Principle of Self-Value

- Value yourself first. 
- Stand up for yourself, don't let others mistreat you.
- Acknowledge that you are not responsible for other people's happiness.
- Take responsibility for yourself and your happiness.
- Limit altruism, do not sacrifice yourself for others.
- Don't be selfless, do not believe others if they claim they are selfless.

#### Principle of Reciprocity

- Follow [the rules of reciprocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_altruism)

#### Principle of Nonmaleficence

- Do not harm others if they don't harm you or anyone else. 
- Do not tolerate, trust or accept those who would use and harm others for selfish reasons. 
- If retaliation is warranted, make sure magnitude is proportional to, and not exceed the intended harm or actual harm (whichever is greater). 
- (Try to) Protect those who are in need, who are harmed by others for selfish reasons. Particularly those who lack the power to protect themselves. 
    - Only if you can, don't be a hero. See principle of self-value, you are not responsible for other people's happiness. 
    - But remember the poem: ["First they came for..."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...)

#### Principle of Loyalty

- Do not betray those who are loyal to you. 
- Be loyal to those you trust, and aim for mutual benefit. 
- Choose your allies well. Go for people who won't betray you and lift you up. 
- In return, provide support and encouragement to your allies. Lift them up. 
- Obey the rule of reciprocity in your interactions, for as long as you wish to sustain a connection. 

#### Principle of Authenticity

- Do what you say. Say what you do. Follow through your promises.
- Don't lie or mislead others without good reason, especially for personal benefit. 
- Be open and honest in your interactions, with people you trust. 
- Have people in your life you can trust, where you can be yourself without judgement. Prioritize and make effort to form such close relationships. 
- Treat others how you want to be treated yourself. 
    - Better yet, treat them how they want to be treated. When feasible. 
- Be open with your feelings and aspirations. First, with yourself. Then, with others you trust. This is important. Accept. 
- Express your thoughts and feelings clearly. Especially when you have a concern. Don't play it off as a joke, nor let someone else dismiss it as a joke. Be aware.
- Know your limits. Be assertive in establishing your boundaries. Don't shy away from conflict if violated. But, pick your fights. Goal is to defend. Avoid unnecessary fights, especially if this is not an repeated interaction. 

#### Principle of Humility and Respect

- Do not think or claim you are more important than others. 
  Everyone is important to themselves from their perspective. 
    - Be aware that your importance to others will generally be proportional to what you can contribute to their lives. 
	- Wish to be more important? Contribute more. 
	- Or better yet, be important to yourself and express love. Outside validation will never be sufficient by itself anyway. 
- Do not judge anyone, unless they harm someone. 
    - But, always assess their potential to be a trustworthy and valuable ally. 
	- Also, evaluate any risks involved. Don't wait for harm to come, take any necessary precautions. Extricate yourself and disconnect if necessary. Remember you are responsible for your well-being. 
- Accept people as they are, and acknowledge you can't change them. You do not have such power, only they do. 
- Admit your mistakes and weaknesses. Be realistic, but don't be too hard on yourself. Try to compensate any damage to others, if feasible. 
    - Similarly, respect those who admit their mistakes and offer them a chance at redemption. People that try to hide their mistakes don't make great allies. 
- Be humble. Do not believe you can cheat your way easily. People aren't stupid. In many cases, it would come back to bite you, sooner or later. 
    - Likewise, do not approach people with an expectation of benefit. The vibe you give will reflect it. 
- Accept that you need other people. Can't do everything by yourself. Can't survive alone, nor live a long, fulfilling life without others. 

#### Principle of Emotionality

- Accept that humans behave emotionally as much as they do logically.
 Learn the necessary skills to navigate both landscapes. 
- This is multi-faceted. Consider the following: 
    - [Emotional awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness) for starters. Learn to name your feelings and be aware of them. Make use of [feeling wheel](https://en.everybodywiki.com/Feeling_Wheel). 
	- [Emotional regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_self-regulation). Learn to manage your emotions without being damaging. 
	- [Emotional expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_expression). Learn to convey your emotions effectively. Acknowledge that it's a subjective experience. Prefer ["I" language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-message) when possible. Don't forget to express positive emotions like love and gratitude. 
	- [Empathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy). Learn to be socially aware and recognize emotions of others. 
	    - Level one, place yourself in other person's position and assess how you would feel. 
		- Level two, assess how they would feel based on their beliefs and perception that are different than yours. 
		- This skill usually brings compassion as well. 
	- [Emotional validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_validation). Learn to convey that you understand and accept other person's emotions. Relate to the situation if you can, "I would have felt the same in that situation". Realize that you do not have to condone actions.
- A caveat: Be aware but don't believe your feelings blindly. Accept them and heed their call. They are very real themselves, but not necessarily what they imply. 
    - For example, suppose you feel guilty. This doesn't necessarily mean you are guilty or made a mistake.
    - Similarly, if you feel anxious, doesn't necessarily mean you are in danger. 
    - Negative emotions are warnings, but they can be false alarms. Use logic to discern. Try to understand the reasons behind if there is a discrepancy. 

#### Principle of Attachment

- Be capable of accepting loss. Don't try to avoid the inevitable. 
- Don't be afraid to attach, it doesn't have to be permanent. 
- Walk away, if a relationship becomes consistently harmful or otherwise not worth it in the long run. 
- Check out [attachment styles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_in_adults#Styles). 

#### Principle of Intimacy

- Aim for consensual, mutual pleasure in sexual relations. 
- Be safe first, then be open and playful. 
- Don't underestimate the effect of mentality, emotionality, and power dynamics.
- Don't assume porn and erotica reflect reality.
- Check out [love languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Love_Languages). Speak the same language.
